Tests were run with r266 but they were associated with the incorrect revision number 265.

Set as the reference revision for: TestTetrisNacLstd, TestTetrisNacLspe, TestTetrisNacLspeAvoidTerm

There are differences in tests TestTetrisNacLstd, TestTetrisNacLspe, and TestTetrisNacLspeAvoidTerm.

Differences are likely to be caused by some difference on numerical level; training proceeds almost identically
while there are differences in test episode returns, in condition numbers and in critic parameters. It seems
that the A and b matrices and vectors have become scaled by exactly 10. The reason is not clear.
